# XtraItemDrops
A Minecraft Java server plugin for Paper servers that provides a wide range of customisation to how items are obtained in the game.

You can find design documentation for this software [here](https://www.notion.so/XtraItemDrops-1fd03f05508e44ee9154dc57e455435d)

This is a personal project to learn TDD and apply a complete design process to a software application. Any additional functionality or bug resolution is done purely from my own personal interest, however my goal is to completely polish the software from start to finish.
